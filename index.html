              I’m a licensed clinical psychologist based in Santa Monica,
              California. I work with adults who are carrying a lot—anxiety,
              trauma, burnout, and the quiet pressure to keep functioning even
              when they feel overwhelmed on the inside.
            </p>
            <p class="section__text">
              My style is warm, collaborative, and grounded. Sessions are
              structured enough to feel supportive, while still leaving room for
              reflection and depth. I integrate cognitive-behavioral therapy
              (CBT), EMDR-informed approaches, mindfulness-based practices, and
              body-oriented techniques so we can address both the emotional and
              physiological sides of what you’re experiencing.
            </p>
            <p class="section__text">
              Trauma work is an important part of my practice. Whether you’re
              navigating a single incident or long-standing patterns rooted in
              earlier experiences, we’ll move at a pace that centers safety and
              regulation. My hope is that therapy not only helps with symptoms,
              but deepens your resilience and your relationship with yourself
              over time.

              you’re sitting on the couch in the room or joining from home, my
              goal is that therapy feels like a safe place to land.
            </p>
            <p class="section__text">
              The building is easily accessible from central Santa Monica, with
              nearby parking and amenities. If you have questions about access,

              details together before your first session.

              I see adults in-person at my office in Santa Monica, California,
              and I also offer secure telehealth sessions for clients located
              anywhere in the state of California. We can discuss which format
              feels most supportive for you right now, and you’re welcome to
              shift between in-person and online as needed.

              My work often focuses on anxiety, panic, trauma, and burnout. I
              frequently support high-achieving, thoughtful adults who feel
              “functional” on the outside while struggling with worry,
              hypervigilance, tension in their body, trouble sleeping, or the
              ongoing impact of earlier experiences on their relationships and
              confidence.

              I integrate several evidence-based approaches, including
              cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), EMDR-informed work,
              mindfulness-based practices, and body-oriented techniques. This
              allows us to pay attention to both your thoughts and the way your
              nervous system is responding, and to tailor our work to what you
              need at a given time.

              Early sessions focus on getting to know you and what brings you in
              now. We’ll talk about your history, current stressors, and what
              you’d like to be different, while also paying attention to how
              things feel in your body as we talk. From there, we’ll collaborate
              on a plan that balances practical tools with deeper exploration,
              so therapy feels both supportive and meaningful.
